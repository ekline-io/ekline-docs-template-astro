A short glossary helps new readers parse the rest of the docs. Replace these
entries with terms specific to your product.

## Account

The top-level container. Every other object — users, widgets, events — belongs
to exactly one account.

## API key

A bearer token used to authenticate requests. See **[Authentication](/get-started/authentication/)**.

## Event

An immutable record describing something that happened on an account. Events
power webhooks and the audit log.

## Idempotency key

A client-generated string that makes it safe to retry a request without
creating duplicates.

## Sandbox

An isolated environment for testing. Data created in the sandbox never affects
production.

## Webhook

An HTTP callback the platform sends to a URL you control whenever an event
occurs.

## Widget

The primary resource in the example API. Rename to match your own domain.
