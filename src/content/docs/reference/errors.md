title: Errors
description: HTTP status codes and error shapes returned by the API.

Every error response has the same JSON shape:

```json
{
  "code": "invalid_request",
  "message": "The `name` field is required.",
  "request_id": "req_01H8Z9XJ7M3K4P5Q6R7S8T9V0W"
}
```

Include `request_id` whenever you contact support — it lets us trace the
specific call in our logs.
